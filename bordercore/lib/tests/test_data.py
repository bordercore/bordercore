"""Tests for the data integrity of models using the SortOrderMixin.

This module contains tests to validate the `sort_order` field for all
Django models that inherit from the common `SortOrderMixin`. It ensures
that for any given group of objects, the sort order forms a dense,
1-based sequence (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ..., N) without any gaps or
duplicate values.
